# Overall Course Assessment

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to give you feedback on your overall grade in
Computer Science 403, Computer Security. With the exception of the template for
requesting the use of a token, there are no files inside of this repository and
you do not need to add any files to this repository.

The course instructor will us this repository to submit overall course
assessment reports to either the issue tracker or the pull requests tracker in
this repository. Students who have questions about any aspect of their course
assessments are encouraged to schedule a meeting with the instructor during
[office hours](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).

## Assessment Categories

As explained on the [course web site](https://securitysynapse.org/), the
grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may change the assigned percentages
during the academic semester. If there are changes to these categories during
the academic semester then they will appear solely on the course web site; the
content in this file is exclusively for a student's quick reference.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Class Participation      |   5%       |
| In-Person Assessments    |  15%       |
| Midterm Examinations     |  10%       |
| Final Examination        |  15%       |
| Security Synapse Projects|   5%       |
| Security Summit Project  |  15%       |
| Security Survey Projects |  35%       |

These assessment categories have the following definitions:

- **Class Participation**: Students are expected to regularly attend and
actively participate in all of the class and laboratory sessions, as outlined
on the course schedule. After either an unexcused absence or a late attendance
to either a class or a laboratory session, a student's weekly class
participation grade will be reduced. Students who need to miss class or attend
class late for an excused reason should communicate their situation to the
course instructor in a timely fashion. A student's weekly class participation
grade will be reduced if they are frequently observed, during either class or
laboratory sessions, undertaking non-course-related activities like viewing
email, social media, or other content not about computer security. 

- **In-Person Assessments**: Conducted through an in-person conversation with
the course instructor, the three in-person assessments are cumulative
evaluations of both high-level and low-level knowledge in the field of computer
security. All students should be prepared to answer questions that assess their
comprehension of both concepts and implementation details in the field of
computer security. The instructor will assess each student response on a
checkmark basis and report feedback through a private GitHub repository.

- **Midterm Examination**: Each midterm examination is an online, executable,
and cumulative assessment covering all prior material from the course sessions,
as outlined on the course schedule. Unless prior arrangements are made with the
instructor, all students should use their computer to take these tests on the
scheduled date and to complete it in the stated location while taking no more
than the required amount of time. Each midterm is an executable examination
that students will complete through the use of GitHub, VS Code, and their
laptop's programming tools. Students may use external sources, including
artificial intelligence coding assistants, during the completion of a midterm
examination provided that they cite these sources and explain how they used
them to complete the examination.

- **Final Examination**: The final examination is an online, executable,
cumulative assessment covering all of the material during all of the course
sessions, as outlined on the course schedule. Unless prior arrangements are
made with the instructor, all students should use their computer to take the
final examination on the scheduled date and to complete it in the stated
location while taking no more than the required amount of time. The cumulative
final is an executable examination that a student will complete through the use
of GitHub, VS Code, and the programming tools installed on their laptops.
Students may use external sources, including artificial intelligence coding
assistants, during the completion of the final examination provided that they
cite these sources and explain how they used them to complete the examination.

- **Security Synapse Projects**: Students who are assigned by the course
instructor to serve as a discussion leader will complete two security synapse
projects during that week. On the Tuesday class session the assigned students
will lead the class in a discussion concerning the practical and ethical
implications of that week's high-level computer security concept(s). On the
Thursday class session the assigned students will demonstrate and explain, using
at least two programming languages studied in the course, the source code in a
GitHub repository that practically connects to the high-level computer security
concepts presented in the prior class session. The discussion leaders will
collaborate with the course instructor to ensure that their prepared materials
make a security synapse between the high-level concepts and low-level
implementation details for their week's technical topic. Students may use
external sources, including artificial intelligence coding assistants, during
the completion of this project provided that they cite these sources and explain
how they used them to complete their work.

- **Security Survey Projects**: These two-week assignments invite students to
make "security synapses" as they survey the implementation details of various
computer security concepts such as cryptography, cryptanalysis, and malware.
These projects are completed through the design, implementation, documentation,
and evaluation of computer programs in languages such as Python, Java,
JavaScript, C, Go, and Rust. Students may use external sources, including
artificial intelligence coding assistants, during the completion of a security
survey project as long as that they cite these sources and explain how they used
them to complete the various components of their project's implementation,
evaluation, and writing.

- **Security Summit Project**: Started in approximately the sixth week of the
academic semester, this long-term project invites students to propose,
implement, evaluate, and present their own advanced project in the field of
computer security. In addition to requiring the completion of a significant and
innovative software tool, this project invites students to complete a series of
presentations and reports. These projects should clearly demonstrate a "security
synapse" both through the connection between high-level concepts and their
low-level implementation and technical concepts discussed in the course and
their practical application to the secure use of real-world computer software.
Students may use external sources, including artificial intelligence coding
assistants, during the completion of this project provided that they cite these
sources and explain how they used them to complete the various components of
their work.

## Token Use Instructions

**Please follow these steps to use one of your two tokens**:

- **Step One**: Create an issue in this repository's issue tracker, using the
  "Token Usage" template in the file referenced in the following section.
- **Step Two**: Send a direct message to the course instructor on Discord,
  sharing the URL of the issue that you created in the previous step.
- **Step Three**: Wait for the course instructor to respond to your issue,
  providing you with feedback on your request to use a token.
- **Step Four**: If the course instructor approves your request to use a token,
  then you should follow the instructions that they provide to you in the
  issue's comments, completing the work by the agreed on schedule.
- **Step Five**: After you complete the work, message the course instructor on
  both GitHub and Discord to let them know that you have completed the work.
- **Step Six**: After you complete the work, the course instructor will
  provide you with feedback on your submission and then close the issue.
- **Step Seven**: Repeat these steps if you would like to use another token, 
  up to the maximum of two tokens during the academic semester.

## Token Use Template

Please refer to the file in this repository called [tokens.md](tokens.md) for
additional instructions for using a token and the token use template that you
should used as the content for the issue in GitHub. If you do not understand how
to use a token, please ask the course instructor for additional clarification in
a public channel in the course's Discord server.
